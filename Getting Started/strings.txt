STRINGS:

There are differnt types of strings in PHP.
> A single quoted string looks like so:

<?php
echo 'hello world'

> The output of this will be, unsuprisingly: 

hello world

> Unlike other types of strings in PHP, variables and escape sequences for special characters
will not be expanded in single quoted strings.
