STRINGS:

There are differnt types of strings in PHP.

>>Single Quoted String
> A single quoted string looks like so:

<?php
echo 'hello world'

> The output of this will be, unsuprisingly: 

hello world

> Unlike other types of strings in PHP, variables and escape sequences for special characters
will not be expanded in single quoted strings.

> Single quoted strings are the easiest way to specifiy a string. Identifying a literal single
quote use a backslash.
Example:

<?php
echo 'Tom\'s mother is named Abbigale.'

> The output will be:

Tom's mother is named Abbigale.

> Every other instace of single quote strings are taken literally, with no special function
or meaning.

>>Double Quoted Strings
>Double quoted strings use a double quote ("). These can contain special characters
