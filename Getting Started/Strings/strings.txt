STRINGS:

There are differnt types of strings in PHP.

>>Single Quoted String
> A single quoted string looks like so:

<?php
echo 'hello world'

> The output of this will be, unsuprisingly: 

hello world

> Unlike other types of strings in PHP, variables and escape sequences for special characters
will not be expanded in single quoted strings.

> Single quoted strings are the easiest way to specifiy a string. Identifying a literal single
quote use a backslash.
Example:

<?php
echo 'The love of Jay\'s life is Daisy.'

> The output will be:

The love of Jay's life is Daisy.

> Every other instace of single quote strings are taken literally, with no special function
or meaning.

>>Double Quoted Strings
> Double quoted strings use a double quote ("). These can contain special characters.

> Similar to single quoted strings, to specify a double quote using a double quoted string use
a backslash.
Example:

<?php
echo "Writing this .txt file is \"fun\"."

> The output will be:

Writing this .txt file is "fun".

> *it actually is fun learning PHP and taking down these notes!

> In the case of both single and doulbe quoted strings, to specify a literal backslash use (\\).

> When using a double quoted string, to specify a dollar sign use (\$).


> There are other sequences while using double quoted strings, however I will take notes on these
in another document.

>>Heredoc
> This is the third type of strings in PHP,
**** I will learn about these later!
